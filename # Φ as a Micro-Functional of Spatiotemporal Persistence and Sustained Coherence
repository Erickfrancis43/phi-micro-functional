# phi-micro-functional
A scale-invariant micro-functional for spatiotemporal organizational persistence, tested across physical.
This repository contains the reference implementation and formal definitions 
associated with the preprint:

"Φ as a Micro-Functional of Spatiotemporal Persistence and Sustained Coherence"

The Φ functional is proposed as a scale-invariant measure of spatiotemporal
organizational persistence, distinct from energy, force, or entropy.
