# Φ as a Micro-Functional of Spatiotemporal Persistence and Sustained Coherence

This repository contains the reference implementation and formal definitions
associated with the preprint:

"Φ as a Micro-Functional of Spatiotemporal Persistence and Sustained Coherence"

The Φ functional is proposed as a scale-invariant measure of spatiotemporal
organizational persistence, distinct from energy, force, or entropy.

## Scope and Non-Scope

Φ is a mathematical-functional construct designed to quantify sustained
organizational persistence in physical systems across scales.

Φ is:
- Not a force
- Not an energy
- Not an entropy measure
- Not a dynamical field equation

This repository focuses exclusively on the micro-scale formalism.
